# Rethinking Testing React Applications
## ü§î‚öõÔ∏è
---
## About Me

- Nick Klepinger
- `bodiddlie` pretty much everywhere
---
## About This Talk

- Entirely subjective
- Just my personal preference
- What's important is what fits for you/your team

```notes
- Entirely subjective
- What's important is what fits for you/your team
- No emperical data, just contrived but realistic examples
```
---
### Let's start with something profound

```notes
- Obvious, but why exactly
- less bugs, protect from regressions,
- Confidence -> Shipping better code -> no late night pages
```

<Appear>
  <h2>Testing is Important</h2>
  <img src={require('file-loader!./public/duh.gif')} />
</Appear>

---
```notes
- Simple component with basic state and click handlers
- obviously contrived, but you get the idea
```

<CodeSurfer 
  title="What We're Testing" 
  theme={nightOwl} 
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/example.js')}
/>
---
export default TopLayout

## What We're Testing

<Example />
---
```notes
test:typical
```

<CodeSurfer 
  title="Typical Testing In React" 
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/typical.test.js')}
  steps={[
    {range: [1, 4], notes: 'Import the necessary stuff'},
    {range: [6, 9], notes: 'Test the intial state'},
    {range: [11, 18], notes: 'Test the decrement click'},
    {range: [20, 27], notes: 'Test the increment click'}
  ]}
/>

## The case against shallow rendering

<ol style={{textAlign: 'left', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Testing implementation details</li>
    <li>False Confidence</li>
  </Appear>
</ol>

```notes
- prev test look fine right?
- there are issues though 
- everything has tradeoffs
```
---
```notes
- Introducing some kind of button component
```

<CodeSurfer
  title="A Simple Refactor..."
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/imp-details.js')}
  steps={[
    {lines: [2, 27, 29], notes: ''}
  ]}
/>
---
```notes
test:impbroke
```

## Means Broken Tests

‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåüò≠
---
```notes
test:imp
- Not the only way to fix
- Could use Component Constructors, displayName, or prop selectors
- but those are all still instances of testing implementation details
```

<CodeSurfer
  title="So Update the Tests"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/imp-details.test.js')}
  steps={[
    {lines: [13, 19]}
  ]}
/>
---
## False Confidence

- Shallow often makes us do crazy things to make tests pass
- Allows for situations where app is broken but tests pass
- Test console is green, user sees red

```notes
- shallow often requires bending things to our will to make tests pass
- we've see green in the console
- user sees red
```
---
```notes
- stupid, contrived example
- just one counter, but assume maybe a number of counters
```

<CodeSurfer
  title="Another simple refactor..."
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/false-conf1.js')}
  steps={[
    {lines: [3, 29], notes: 'Adding some kind of display component'}
  ]}
/>
---
export default TopLayout

```notes
test:false
```

## New Display

<FalseConf1 />
---
```notes
test:falsefix
```

<CodeSurfer
  title="Tests Are Broken, So Now Fix"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/false-conf1.test.js')}
  steps={[
    {lines: [14, 20]}
  ]}
/>
---
```notes
- very contrived example, but illustrates problem
```
<CodeSurfer
  title="A Bad Change in the Display Component"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/display-code.js')}
  steps={[
    {range: [3, 7]},
    {lines: [9]},
  ]}
/>
---
export default TopLayout

```notes
test:falsestill after demoing!!!!!!
- let's look at the tests?
```

## Yeah That's Not Right

<BadFalseConf2 />
---
## Tests Still Passing

## üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
## Why Not Shallow Rendering?

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>
  <li>Testing Implementation Details
    <ul>
      <li>Top priority is to ensure the app is working</li>
      <li>Focus on end result, not details</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>False Confidence
    <ul>
      <li>Something broken lower in the tree might not surface</li>
      <li>Relying on untested (at this level) code to be right</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

---
```notes
- providers are mostly logic based
- do a shallow render and verify values are generated/provided correctly
- fetch component as example
```

## Where Shallow Is Still Good

- Provider components
- Pure logic components with no UI
---
```notes
- Kent C Dodds created
- ethos of taking bigger picture into account
- focus on app means higher confidence.
```

## Enter React-Testing-Library

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Testing UI from User perspective, not implementation details</li>
    <li>Much higher confidence</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
## Test from the perspective of the user

- Get elements with `getByText`, `getByLabelText`, `getByTestId`, etc.
- Think about content in a semantic and user oriented way
- Pushes toward more accessible UI
- Assert that user behavior drives app, not implmentation details
---
```notes
test:nomore
```

<CodeSurfer
  title="No More Implementation Details"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/example-rtl.test.js')}
  steps={[
    {range: [1, 3], notes: 'New Imports'},
    {lines: [7], notes: 'Full Render requires DOM cleanup'},
    {range: [9, 12], notes: 'Interact & assert on the UI'},
    {ranges: [[14, 18], [20, 24]]},
    {lines:[16, 22], notes: 'Get the buttons by their text'}
  ]}
/>
---
## Feel More Confident

- Full render means we're not hiding child components
- If the app is broken for the user, the test is broken for us
- Assert that content is correct, not state
---
```notes
test:confident
```

<CodeSurfer
  title="No More False Positives"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./components/confident-rtl.test.js')}
  steps={[
    {lines: [5], notes: 'This component passed our tests before...'},
    {range: [9, 24], notes: 'Test code is identical to last suite...'}
  ]}
/>
---
## React-Testing-Library API ‚ù§Ô∏è

- `get*` and `query*` methods are **so** nice to work with
- working with forms is üëç
- `jest-dom` provides some very helpful expect extensions

```notes
- get and query functions are from dom-testing-library
- getByLabelText is super handy for filling forms like a user
- toHaveTextContent and toBeVisible are very handy
```
---
## Some Arguments Against

- This is integration testing not unit testing
- Need to unit test logic

```notes
```
---
## Integration vs Unit 

<img src={require('file-loader!./public/rauch.png')} />

```notes
- already covered tests are important
- too many tests is hard to maintain
- integration tests give greater confidence
- yes slower, but again, not too many
```
---
## Need to Unit Test Logic?

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Absolutely! See duh.gif</li>
    <li>Too much logic in UI is code smell</li>
    <li>Pull logic out into module and unit test</li>
    <li>Mocking instance methods is a code smell, move into modules</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>
---
## Test UI in sensible chunks

<ul style={{textAlign: 'left', fontSize: '1.5em'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Test at the highest level that makes sense.</li>
    <li>Good practice to lift state up, why not lift tests?</li>
    <li>Test too low - hard too see big picture - implementation details</li>
    <li>Test too high - too zoomed out - harder to make it work</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
- about finding the good middle ground
- comp only makes sense in context of surrounding comps? go up
- mocking out tons of network calls, or test way too slow? go down
```
---
## Cypress for e2e or integration

- Selenium has always been somewhat torturous to use
- Easy to get started with
- Much nicer API to work with
- Even a `cypress-testing-library` available

---
## DEMO

```notes
- yarn start:server
```
---
```notes
- fixtures pull data from json easily
```

<CodeSurfer
  title="Testing is Super Simple"
  theme={nightOwl}
  code={require('!raw-loader!./cypress/integration/people.spec.js')}
  steps={[
    {range: [3, 5], notes: 'Mocking out the backend'},
    {lines: [6], notes: 'Visit the app'},
    {lines: [10, 15], notes: 'Click on the button'},
    {lines: [11, 16], notes: 'Assert value is what you expext'},
  ]}
/>
---
## DEMO

```notes
- yarn cypress:open 
- show command log to show changes
- show clicking on element to get selector
```
---
## Mocking/Stubbing in e2e 

- Consider your environment
- If you can test against a real backend, go for it
- Don't feel it's absolutely necessary

```notes
- ideally, a e2e test is truly e2e
- don't always have luxury
- staging dbs for testing, resetting, auth, etc, can get in way
- containers and other tech can help
- test as wide as possible
- nothing wrong with mocking and making sure frontend works
```
---
## Test Like a User

- RTL & Cypress encourage this
- Zoom out a little
- Be much more confident in what tests say
---
## Confidence > Coverage

I'd rather have 50% coverage but be 100% confident that the vital parts won't break, than have
100% coverage and need to have tums and a pager on my nightstand.
